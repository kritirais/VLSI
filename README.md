# VLSI
This repository contains hardware programming problems in Verilog. The program is compiled using Synopsys VCS Compiler using the following syntax.
SYNTAX:
vcs -full64 -sverilog top.v test_top.v && ./simv

The code can either be run on linux environment by properly accessing the path of the tool and the license file.

Online compilers like EDA Playground can also be used. The design file (top.v) should be pasted in the design.sv tab and the testbench file (test_top.v) should be pasted in the testbench.sv file in the EDA Playground simulator. Choose the appropriate compiler and run the test.
